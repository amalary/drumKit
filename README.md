# drumKit
This is a simple drum kit project that plays different drum sounds when you press keys on your keyboard. The project is built using JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply clone this repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser. You can also access the project online by visiting the project page here.

# How to Use
To play a drum sound, simply press the corresponding key on your keyboard. Each key on the keyboard is mapped to a different drum sound. The project supports multiple keys, so you can play multiple sounds at the same time.

# Code Overview
The code for this project is written in JavaScript and consists of two functions - playSound and removeTransition.

# playSound
The playSound function is called when a key is pressed on the keyboard. It checks if the key that was pressed corresponds to a drum sound, and if it does, it plays the sound and adds a playing class to the corresponding key element in the HTML.

# removeTransition
The removeTransition function is called when a CSS transition ends. It removes the playing class from the element that triggered the transition, which in this case is the key element.
